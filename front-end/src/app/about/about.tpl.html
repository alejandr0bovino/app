     is an opinionated kickstarter for web
      development projects. It's an attempt to create a simple starter for new
      web sites and apps: just download it and start coding. The goal is to
      have everything you need to get started out of the box; of course it has
      slick styles and icons, but it also has a best practice directory structure
      to ensure maximum code reuse. And it's all tied together with a robust
      build system chock-full of some time-saving goodness.
