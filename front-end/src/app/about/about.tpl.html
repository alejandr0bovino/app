       is an opinionated kickstarter for web
        development projects. It's an attempt to create a simple starter for new
        web sites and apps: just download it and start coding. The goal is to
        have everything you need to get started out of the box; of course it has
        slick styles and icons, but it also has a best practice directory structure
        to ensure maximum code reuse. And it's all tied together with a robust
        build system chock-full of some time-saving goodness.
